## Project idea
When we first talked about our project we discussed about different themes that would be interesting to deepen. One of them was bacteria culture and we were impressed by how such a scientific matter could be turned into something pleasant to see.
We thought: how can something so nasty as bacteria look so nice on that little dish?
That’s when we decided we wanted to work on this subject and we started thinking of the process of bacteria culture and how to illustrate it to everyone in a very simple and intuitive way.

## Design challenges
The hard part of the project was deciding the steps that would make the process understandable for everyone. It was pretty clear to us because we analyzed it but we though that it might look complicated for others. So we simplified the whole thing to 3 main passages: spreading the gel on the Petri dish, dropping the colorants in it and then, once the cultures are shown, rubbing hands to experience how hard it is to eliminate all the bacteria on our hands.

## Graphic style
We wanted to have a very clean and simple style to represent a scientific setting but also use some color to give it a more lively look. We decided to use colors that recall the laboratory setting combined with the bright and playful colors of the bacteria cultures. We also chose a font, Josefin Sans, that would look simple but also not too serious or stiff.

## Interactions
Most of the interactions can be carried out with the mouse and there’s one last interaction which requires the use of the hands. We thought that this kind of interaction, different from the regular click, would engage the users more. In this way the site is less aseptic and they can comprehend the whole process better.

## Code challenges
We faced a few challenges, code-wise, on this project. 
The biggest was how to keep the selections in the map page stay still while exploring around. We worked hard but we finally found a solution in order to let the user have a full experience of the map without having to go back to a certain point of the canvas to use the selection.
Another bug is related to the gel interaction, where we wanted the circle, that needs to be moved around, not to go beyond the circular canvas (the Petri dish). We solved this too, but we were not able to write a code to let the computer know when the Petri dish is full and therefore pass on to the next page. The latter is the only bug we were not able to solve.
We are aware that the code might not be written in the simplest and most correct way, but since we are new to this kind of code writing we thought that the most important thing was to make it work properly.

## Inspirations
In particular, we have been mostly inspired by the work of Klari (here you can visit her website https://www.klariart.com/petri/), that collaborated with microbiologists to create artistic Petri dishes in which bacteria had grown. We were amazed by how science can be seen from a different perspective and explored through this fuzzy line between the technological and the natural.
